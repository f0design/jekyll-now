Malaysia’s Bribery Law Got a Makeover in 2018. This change came after Parliament passed a bill in April 2018 to amend the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009, crucially with the insertion of Section 17A. In this post we dig into what you need to know.

The relevant authority in charge of the MACCA is the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC). The MACCA applies to both the private sector and to public bodies / officers of a public body. The MACCA does not make a distinction between private sector bribery and bribery of public officials.
Since its election victory, the new Malaysian government under the leadership of Dr Mahathir Mohamad has continued to aggressively pursue its anti-corruption agenda through the establishment of the Special Cabinet Committee on Anti-Corruption (JKKMAR) and the Governance, Integrity and Anti-Corruption Centre (GIACC); the formulation of the National Anti-Corruption Plan; and the reopening of investigations into the 1MDB scandal, which have recently led to criminal charges being brought against former Prime Minister Najib Razak. By 2030, Malaysia aims to be one of the top 10 cleanest nations in the world. 
Malaysian Parliament has adopted features of the UK Bribery Act into the MACC Act.

1. Offence of the Associated Person

The new section provides that a commercial organization commits an offence if an associated person engages in corruption in order to obtain or retain business or an advantage for the organization.

The new section not only establishes a new statutory corporate liability offence of corruption by a commercial organisation, but also deems any director, controller, officer, manager or partner to be personally liable for the same offence unless the relevant individual can prove that the offence was committed without their consent and that they had exercised the requisite due diligence to prevent the commission of the offence.

This provides the much-needed ammunition to MACC in the war on corruption.
The SFO is the enforcer of the UK Bribery Act 2010. There were many murmurs and statistics on how the US Regulators of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977 were far more aggressive in their reach and approach than the UK. Finally, this somewhat halted in February 2016, when construction and professional services company Sweett Group was convicted and punished for failing to prevent an act of bribery intended to secure and retain a contract with an insurance company in the United Arab Emirates.

PwC’s Global Economic Crime and Fraud Survey 2018 suggests that bribery and corruption in Malaysia is on the rise, with 35% of respondents reporting that their organisations had experienced such incidents in the last two years, compared with 19% in 2014 and 30% in 2016. With Malaysia scoring 47 on the transparency international CPI index. The walk to reaching the target of top 10 cleanest countries to do business in, is a long walk. Unless over hauls such as these are quickly implemented. The public release of the 1MDB report in Malaysia signals an important milestone. 

A commercial organisation convicted of an offence under Section 17A can be fined not less than 10 times the gratification paid or offered, or RM1m, whichever is higher or imprisonment up to 20 years or both.
Constructive steps for Organisations to consider

Section 17A is a corporate liability provision thus it does not matter whether the companies had actual knowledge of the corrupt actions of these associated persons. 

Much like the UK, the burden is now on the company to show that they had in place adequate procedures designed to prevent associated persons from undertaking corrupt practices. If you have not conducted due diligence on your vendors, suppliers, agents’ resellers, distributors, channel partners our proprietary AI enabled tool SEEKER™ will do a thorough search for you. SEEKER™ will highlight red flags while suggesting ways to mitigate those red flags.

Adequate procedures are pivotal as a defense – as a corporation is guilty unless proven innocent under this strict corporate liability offence.

Commercial organisations and management will need to step up monitoring of its associated persons for corrupt practices. Seeker ™ runs these checks swiftly in a flexible manner - the frequency of checks can be customized, including reminders closer to contract expiration date, to review and renew due diligence checks. 
Gifts, entertainment, contracts with no Anti-bribery corruption clauses need to be revisited as these are funnels for facilitating bribes. ReadyComply provides services to help raise awareness, create engaging impactful training to help allow the organisation to avoid liability.
