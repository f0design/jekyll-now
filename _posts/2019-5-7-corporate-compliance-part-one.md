“Effective compliance programs play a critical role in preventing misconduct, facilitating investigations, and informing fair resolutions”, Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski said.

Part of I of the guidance discusses:

1. Risk-assessment

Prosecutors may credit the quality and effectiveness of a risk-based compliance program that devotes appropriate attention and resources to high-risk transactions, even if it fails to prevent an infraction in a low-risk area. 
Thus, revisions to corporate compliance programs considering lessons learned, is an important metric to be considered while designing your risk-based compliance programme.

2. Policies and Procedures

Does the company have established policies and procedures that incorporate the culture of compliance into its day-to-day operations? Have you operationalized compliance?
Is your Code of Conduct and are your other policies comprehensive, accessible not hidden in a shared drive many clicks away?  
Can employees whose first language is not English comprehend the document. Is it written simply, plainly and/or available in local languages?
Have you used technology to make it easy to adopt a policy example integrating your Gifts & Hospitality Policy into your finance portal for gifts and hospitality reimbursement. 
Have you trained your internal gatekeepers or control teams such as finance, procurement and fulfillment or operations, on things to watch out for and escalate to the compliance team? 

3. Training and Communication

Engagement is the key. Like most corporate compliance departments that have a very lean budget have you at least trained employees who need to enforce controls?
Have you trained your people managers - who lead by example, your middle managers? It’s also important to run trainings on incidents that may have occurred as a lesson learnt scenario to employees, this brings the point home, that the risk is real and is also an effort to mitigating such a risk in the future. 
Once again, the guidance reiterates that tone from the top is critical.

4. Confidential Reporting Structure and Investigation Process

The focus again and rightly so, is on whistleblower protection and non-retaliation processes. Safety to spot and share misconduct or suspected breaches at every level should be built into the programme. Along with this the employees should be made aware of the reporting mechanisms; the investigations should be run by appropriately qualified personnel. The response times should be prompt and reasonable. These metrics must be tracked. Several hotline providers provide reporting metrics.
